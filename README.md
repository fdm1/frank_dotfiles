This contains extra dotfiles, including 'local' vimrc/vim plugins.
The vim additions are meant to be loaded along side https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles

To install:

```
$ bash activate.sh
```

This will symlink all personal files to the root directory, clone braintreeps/vim_dotfiles (if needed), pull that repo,
and activate/install everything.
