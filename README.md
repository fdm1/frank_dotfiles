Install
-------

Install ansible (however necessary)

```
./run_ansible.sh
```

Requirements / Setup
--------------------

Requires:
* ansible

TODOS
-------------------

- This currently does not install any packages. It assumes you have nvim, git, and tmux already installed. That will come later.

- install homebrew
- install other things
  - neovim gem (globally)
  - yarn (via npm) 
  - npm neovim (via npm)

- Separate `macosx` OS with `root` so I can have personal and work-specific mac configs
